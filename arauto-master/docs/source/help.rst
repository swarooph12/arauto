How to contribute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Currently, this project is maintained by just one person. It would be great to have more people collaborating and contributing with this open-source project. If you want to collaborate with Arauto, here's what you can do:

- **Documentation and tutorial**: it's really important to make users get into Arauto as soon as they open the browser. Tutorials and deeper documentation could help us to achieve it.
- **New algorithms**: there are many different algorithms that we could add to Arauto, like ARCH, VAR, and Tree-based algorithms, to name a few. All you need to do is fork the repository, build the feature and open a PR to merge it.
- **Bug fixes**: something might be broken. We need good people to fix it.
- **Tests**: Arauto doesn't contain tests, and this is wrong.
